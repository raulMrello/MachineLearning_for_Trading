    "\n",
    "Along this notebook, I'm going to detail the design of a trading bot through a Machine Learning algorithm. This ML-algo will have different stages, that will act as a waterfall process, where the result of one stage will feed the next one, and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "These are the main stages (detailed on next sections), in which the ML-algo is divided:\n",
    "\n",
    "- A pattern recognition submodule, to identify different market conditions.\n",
    "- A RL-agent, to forecast price movements in short-term future, from market conditions generated by the previous stage.\n",
    "- A RL-agent, to setup and execute long-short operations with stoploss, takeprofit and partial-close levels; from the forecast generated by the previous agent.\n"

    "## Market conditions\n",
    "\n",
    "Financial instruments always move in zigzag sequences, forming 3 kinds of trends as the [Elliott Waves theory](https://stockcharts.com/school/doku.php?id=chart_school:market_analysis:introduction_to_elliott_wave_theory) explains:\n",
    "<img src=\"https://d.stockcharts.com/school/data/media/chart_school/market_analysis/introduction_to_elliott_wave_theory/wave8.png\" alt=\"Drawing\" style=\"width: 400px;\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "Along those zigzags different market conditions can be observed:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Bullish trends: where the price goes higher\n",
    "- Lateral channels: where the price fluctuates between a more or less defined range.\n",
    "- Bearish trends: where the price goes lower\n",
    "\n",
    "Also, is common that price can vary between a well defined channel, as shown below:\n",
    "<img src=\"https://bpcdn.co/images/2016/05/grade1-channel-thumbnail.png\" alt=\"Drawing\" style=\"width: 400px;\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "So, areas near the channel's limits are critical, because price can twist to the other side or break the channel to start a lateral range or a change of trend.\n",
    "\n",
    "For those reasons, the pattern recognition submodule will observe one or more candlestick charts of a financial instrument with the help of several indicators (like MACD, Bollinger, ...) to generate an estimation of the current market condition.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"img/market-condition-generator.jpg\" alt=\"Drawing\" style=\"width: 400px;\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "This submodule will produce a combination of variables that in turn will form the market condition identification:\n",
